These are my solutions to the problems on 4clojure.com.

I'm putting these up on github just as a record of having done them, 
for those not registered on www.4clojure.com. Note that I've generally 
tried to make the code readable, rather than as small as possible. Also,
I've learned Clojure as I was doing these problems, so there are plenty of
the earlier problems especially where the method I got to work initially 
(i.e. what is checked in here) is not what I would do now.

And, obviously... SPOILERS herein.
